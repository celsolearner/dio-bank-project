# dio-bank-project
A simple project done to participate in the Quebec Java Digital Bootcamp, a partnership between DIO and the government of Quebec. Target: people who wish to work in Quebec. This java project has a big main file with all events, Java components, etc., and only some comments. It isn't considered good programming practice, but time is relentless.</br>
